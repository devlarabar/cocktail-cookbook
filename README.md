Girls Night In was created as a passion project, for the love of both code and cocktails. The intuitive interface allows users to search for their favorite cocktails, and returns their ingredients and recipes. 

Users may also use the **filter** feature to filter through the list of cocktail recipes returned in their search, to find exactly what they were looking for.
